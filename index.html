            <h1>Let's Help Those Who Are<br> More In Need </h1>
            <p>Our country is facing a devastating flood while suffering from the COVID pandemic and is in urgent need of our help. Almost one-third of Bangladesh is underwater, Forecast prediction says that we are gonna experience worse flooding in the coming days. Already, more than 2.8 million people have been affected, including over 1 million who remain isolated and surrounded by floodwaters also lost their houses and belongings . They need help from us-who is still not affected. So , we tried to create a small step for helping and collecting more help from others for the people who are fighting against the flood. Let's give a hand together....</p>
